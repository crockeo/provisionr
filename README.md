## Overview

`provisionr` is a self-hostable service that
lets teams manage their engineering organization's structure
and synchronize those changes out to many vendors at once.
It's all the fun of `tofu apply` with none of the "writing OpenTofu."

This is currently under development, and is not very useful for the time being.
I would suggest checking back in the near future to see more progress.
