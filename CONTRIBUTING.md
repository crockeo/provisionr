# Contributing

## Local Development

This project makes extensive use of [just](https://github.com/casey/just) and [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv).
Ensure these are installed before continuing.

Then you can install and run the frontend + backend with:

```shell
just dev
```

You can also run tests with:

```shell
just test
```

If you intend to contribute code back upstream,
I would also suggest installing [pre-commit](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit)
and running:

```shell
pre-commit install
```
